# Valkey ACL Configuration Examples
# 
# IMPORTANT: Valkey ACL files do NOT support comment-only lines with #
# All lines must be valid ACL rules (user definitions)
# 
# Format: user <username> <status> >password ~<keypattern> &<channelpattern> +<command>
#
# Components:
#   <username>         - Username for authentication
#   <status>          - 'on' (enabled) or 'off' (disabled)
#   >password         - Password (use 'nopass' for no password, can have multiple passwords)
#   ~<keypattern>     - Key access pattern (~* = all keys, ~app:* = keys starting with app:)
#   &<channelpattern> - Pub/Sub channel pattern (&* = all channels)
#   +<command>        - Allowed commands (+@all = all commands, +@read = read-only)

# ============================================================================
# ACTIVE CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

# Default user with full permissions (required - do not comment out)
user default on >mysecretpassword ~* &* +@all

# ============================================================================
# EXAMPLE USERS (uncomment and modify as needed)
# ============================================================================

# GoDNS application user with full permissions
# user godns on >godnspassword ~* &* +@all

# Read-only user (can only execute read commands)
# user readonly on >readonlypass ~* &* +@read

# User with access only to keys starting with "app:"
# user appuser on >apppass ~app:* &* +@all

# User with multiple passwords
# user multipass on >password1 >password2 ~* &* +@all

# Disabled user (for temporary access revocation)
# user tempuser off >temppass ~* &* +@all

# User without password (not recommended for production)
# user nopassuser on nopass ~* &* +@all

# User with specific command permissions
# user limiteduser on >limitedpass ~* &* +get +set +del

# ============================================================================
# SECURITY BEST PRACTICES
# ============================================================================
# 
# 1. Change default password immediately
# 2. Create specific users for different applications
# 3. Use principle of least privilege (minimal permissions needed)
# 4. Use strong passwords (long, random, complex)
# 5. Rotate passwords regularly
# 6. Monitor access with ACL LOG
# 7. Use key patterns to restrict access (~app:* instead of ~*)
# 8. Disable users instead of deleting (for audit trail)
#
# ============================================================================
# COMMON ACL COMMAND CATEGORIES
# ============================================================================
#
# +@all        - All commands
# +@read       - Read-only commands (GET, SCAN, etc.)
# +@write      - Write commands (SET, DEL, etc.)
# +@admin      - Administrative commands
# +@dangerous  - Potentially dangerous commands (FLUSHDB, KEYS, etc.)
# +@keyspace   - Commands that interact with key space
# +@string     - String commands
# +@list       - List commands
# +@set        - Set commands
# +@sortedset  - Sorted set commands
# +@hash       - Hash commands
# +@pubsub     - Pub/Sub commands
#
# To deny a category: -@dangerous
# To allow specific command: +get +set
# To deny specific command: -flushdb
